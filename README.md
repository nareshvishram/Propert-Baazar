1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT- PROPERTY BAAZAR
One of the tasks of any manager is to plan and control the organization in the way that the organization can achieve its goals. Issues relative to the well-being of men like shelter and other issues are very important to take decisions in the organization. With the help of property bazaar those issues would be easily tackled. This property bazaar is software where property details such as available house details, schedules, address, and others are been set up by an administrator. ‘Property Bazaar’ is basically a Web Application based on java that will be used by the various Tenants, Landlords, and Brokers. It will be based on the spring framework and will be having various functionalities for the automation of the property-related problems. The project is aimed at developing an online portal for property details for Property seekers. The project has been planned to be having a view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database. The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of the MS-SQL Server and all the user interfaces have been designed using the JSP. The database connectivity is planned using the “SQL Connection” methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanisms have been given a big choice for proper usage. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forwarded by the administrative staff.

1.2 Aims
-> The main aim of this project is to ensure that management abides by regulations and laws when interacting with tenants and vendors. -> Another aim is to match with properties for sale by several bedrooms/price criteria. -> It also aims to allow easy entry of Property and vendor details

1.3 Objective
-> To list all viewings for property -> To display matched property details easily and quickly with one click. -> To maintain client details like contact details, required property details, client type like a residential and commercial client. Price limit. Preference. -> To maintain property details, registration of property for sale includes property address, property description, price, facilities available. Store property floor plan, property documents. Creation of thumbnail of property images for brochure.

1.4 PROBLEMS IN EXISTING SYSTEM
The property management system for this organization uses the traditional method of keeping records of the client’s files. This manual record-keeping in the organization has been characterized by a lot of problems, such as a. Lack of skill in the interpretation of reports from the activities of the organization. b. Data losses: loss of data perhaps would happen if all information was only kept inside the paper. c. Data redundancies: abundant and repetitive data also perhaps will happen. d. No database to store information: by using a manual system, loss of data perhaps will happen. e. No backup and security: still information to contemporary system perhaps have been trespassed easily or stolen, this is because of the insecurity in the manual system used in the organization

1.5 SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS
User-Friendly Interface. -> Security measures have been taken. -> The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible. -> To list all viewings for the property.

1.6 MODULES
Landlord module: The landlord can perform the following activities by login into the platform. -> Login -> Post Property -> Update information

Tenant Module: This module will provide an online environment to the tenant/property buyer to check the property’s information. Tenant can perform following activities: -> Login -> Search Property -> View Property -> Contact Landlord

Broker Module: This module will provide an online environment to the tenant/property buyer to check Broker’s information. The tenant can see the following information about brokers: -> Broker’s Name -> Broker’s Contact Information

           

SYSTEM ANALYSIS
2.1 INTRODUCTION
After analyzing the requirements of the task to be performed, the next step is to analyze the problem and understand its context. The first activity in the phase is studying the existing system and the other is to understand the requirements and domain of the new system. Both the activities are equally important, but the first activity serves as a basis for giving the functional specifications and then the successful design of the proposed system. Understanding the properties and requirements of a new system is more difficult and requires creative thinking and understanding of the existing running system is also difficult, improper understanding of the present system can lead to diversion from solution.

2.2 ANALYSIS MODEL
The model that is basically being followed is the WATERFALL MODEL, which states that the phases are organized in a linear order. First of all the feasibility study is done. Once that part is over the requirement analysis and project planning begins. If a system exists one and modification and addition of a new module is needed, analysis of the present system can be used as the basic model.

The design starts after the requirement analysis is complete and the coding begins after the design is complete. Once the programming is completed, the testing is done. In this model, the sequence of activities performed in a software development project are: -

-> Requirement Analysis -> Project Planning -> System design -> Detail designs -> Coding -> Unit testing -> System integration & testing

Here the linear ordering of these activities is critical. The end of the phase and the output of one phase is the input of the other phase. The output of each phase is to be consistent with the overall requirement of the system. Some of the qualities of the spiral model are also incorporated like after the people concerned with the project review completion of each of the phases the work done.

WATERFALL MODEL was being chosen because all requirements were known beforehand and the objective of our software development is the computerization/automation of an already existing manual working system.

REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
Information gathering is usually the first phase of the software development project. The purpose of this phase is to identify and document the exact requirements for the system.

3.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
-> WINDOWS OS -> Eclipse I.D.E. -> MS-SQL -> Apache Tomcat Server.

3.2 TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Presentation layer 1.1.1 HTML 1.1.2 CSS
JavaScript
Database 3.1.1 SQL
Business Layer 4.1.1 Core Java 4.1.2 Advanced Java 4.1.3 SpringMvc
3.2 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Hardware Specification: Server Processor: Intel P-IV (or above) RAM: 512 MB (or above) Hard disk: 20 GB (or above) Client Processor: Celeron 500 MHz or more, Intel Pentium III (or above) RAM: 128 MB RAM (or above) Hard disk: 10 GB (or above)

FUTURE SCOPE AND FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE PROJECT
10.1 Future Scope
As per the user Requirement, our whole project is designed. We can add the constraint to our project. We will also try to make the modification, update, delete, any other facility in our project. This can be used in educational institutions as well as for another commercial purpose. Some of them are:-

-> This can be used in educational institutions as well as the incorporation of the world. -> Business relationship with comprehensive online services like transport, banking, etc. -> Affiliate Marketing Systems, Web site Design, and Development and Search Engine optimization. -> Integration with other standard Application Software Products &Booking Engines / Platforms, Fare & Content Management Systems

10.2 Further Enhancement
Nothing is perfect in this world. So, we are also no exception. Although, we have tried our best to present the information effectively, yet, there can be a further enhancement in the Application.

We have taken care of all the critical aspects, which need to take care of during the development of the Project. Like the things this project also has some limitations and can further be enhanced by someone, because certain drawbacks do not permit the system to be 100% accurate. The application is yet to be released and a lot of enhancements are already thought of which are proposed to be implemented in the final version of the web-application. The web-application has also provided a feedback page on its home page so that the users can provide their inputs of any functionalities/facilities they would like to have in the web application.

The system is a highly flexible one and is well efficient to make easy interactions with the client. The key focus is given on data security, as the project is online and will be transferred to the network. The speed and accuracy will be maintained properly.

his will be a user-friendly one and can successfully overcome strict and severe validation checks. The system will be a flexible one and changes whenever can be made easy. Using the facility and flexibility in .NET and SQL, the software can be developed neatly and some by reducing the operator’s work.

Since the project is developed in .NET as a front-end and SQL Server as a back-end it can be modified easily and used for a long period. Following are some of the enhancements proposed to be implemented in the final version.

-> Maps are provided to facilitate the users. -> Lease option should be provided regarding properties. -> Give access to the website on mobile and PDAs -> Send SMS to the property owner who has registered and uploaded his property. -> Giving property site for all metro cities. -> Upload videos / 3d views of the property.

CONCLUSION
Working on the project was a good experience. I understand the importance of Planning and Designing as a part of software development. But it’s very difficult to complete the program for a single person.

the system provides major advantages such as speed and accuracy of operation, Time Efficiency, Cost Efficiency, Automatic data validation, Data security and reliability, Easy performance check, Dynamic, and User Friendly. Generates real-time, comprehensive reports and ensures access to complete and critical information, instantly.
