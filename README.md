Settling down in a new city is always a head-ache for everyone or if you wanna start a new business into a new town then you might need some properties in order to set up your business. But you are not familiar with this town so how would you suppose to do that?
Yes, to get rid of this problem I have developed this project where tenants can buy a property from the landlord via a middle person who is known as a broker.

Used tools and technologies: Java, Spring ,Maven, JSP, JDBC, MySql , HTML , CSS , BOOTSTRAP etc.
