# Propert-Baazar

# 1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT- PROPERTY BAAZAR
One of the tasks of any manager is to plan and control the organization in the way that the organization can achieve its goals. Issues relative with the well-being of man like shelter and others issues are very important to take decision in the organization. With the help of property baazar those issues would be easily tackle. This property baazar is a software where property details such as available house details, schedules, address, and others are been setup by an administrator.
‘Property Bazaar’ is basically a Web Application based on java which will be used by the various Tenants, Landlords and Brokers. It will be based on spring framework and will be having various functionalities for the automation of the property related problems.
The project is aimed at developing an online portal for the property details for Property seekers.
The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database. The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of MS-SQL Server and all the user interfaces have been designed using the jsp. The database connectivity is planned using the “SQL Connection” methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanism have been given a big choice for proper usage. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forwarded by the administrative staff.

# 1.2 Aims
-> The main aim of this project is to ensure that management abides by regulations and laws when interacting with tenants and vendors.
-> Another aim is to match with properties for sale by number of bedrooms / price criteria.
-> It also aim to allow easy entry of Property and vendor details

# 1.3 Objective
-> To list all viewings for property
-> To display matched property details easily and quickly by one click.
-> To maintain client details line contact details, required property details, client type like residential and commercial client. Price limit. Preference.
-> To maintain property details, registration of property for sale includes property address, property description, price, facilities available. Store property floor plan, property documents. Creation of thumbnail of property images for brochure.

# 1.4 PROBLEMS IN EXISITING SYSTEM
Property management system for this organization uses traditional method of keeping records of the client’s files. This manual record keeping in the organization has been characterized by a lot of problems, such as:
a. Lack of skill in interpretation of reports from the activities of the organization.
b. Data losses: loss of data perhaps would happen if all information only kept inside paper on. 
c. Data redundancies: abundant and repetition data also perhaps will happen. 
d. No database to store information: by using manual system, loss of data perhaps will happen. 
e. No backup and security: still information to contemporary system perhaps have been trespassed easily or stolen, this is because of the insecurity in the manual system used in the organization

# 1.5 SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS
User Friendly Interface.
-> Security measures have been taken.
-> The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.
-> To list all viewings for property.

# SYSTEM ANALYSIS

# 2.1 INTRODUCTION
After analyzing the requirements of the task to be performed, the next step is to analyze the problem and understand its context. The first activity in the phase is studying the existing system and other is to understand the requirements and domain of the new system. Both the activities are equally important, but the first activity serves as a basis of giving the functional specifications and then successful design of the proposed system. Understanding the properties and requirements of a new system is more difficult and requires creative thinking and understanding of existing running system is also difficult, improper understanding of present system can lead diversion from solution.

# 2.2 ANALYSIS MODEL

The model that is basically being followed is the WATER FALL MODEL, which states that the phases are organized in a linear order. First of all the feasibility study is done. Once that part is over the requirement analysis and project planning begins. If system exists one and modification and addition of new module is needed, analysis of present system can be used as basic model.

The design starts after the requirement analysis is complete and the coding begins after the design is complete. Once the programming is completed, the testing is done. In this model the sequence of activities performed in a software development project are: -

-> Requirement Analysis
-> Project Planning
-> System design
-> Detail designs
-> Coding
-> Unit testing
-> System integration & testing

Here the linear ordering of these activities is critical. End of the phase and the output of one phase is the input of other phase. The output of each phase is to be consistent with the overall requirement of the system. Some of the qualities of spiral model are also incorporated like after the people concerned with the project review completion of each of the phase the work done.

WATER FALL MODEL was being chosen because all requirements were known beforehand and the objective of our software development is the computerization/automation of an already existing manual working system.

# REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

# FUTURE SCOPE AND FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE PROJECT
# 10.1 Future Scope
As per the user Requirement our whole project is designed. We can add an additional constraint to our project. We will also try to make the modification, update, delete, any other facility in our project. This can be used in educational institutions as well as for other commercial purpose. Some of them are:-

-> This can be used in educational institutions as well as in corporate world.
-> Business relationship with comprehensive online services like transport, banking etc.
-> Affiliate Marketing Systems, Web site Design, and Development and Search Engine optimization.
-> Integration with other standard Application Software Products &Booking Engines / Platforms, Fare & Content Management Systems

# 10.2 Further Enhancement
Nothing is perfect in this world. So, we are also no exception. Although, we have tried our best to present the information effectively, yet, there can be further enhancement in the Application.

We have taken care of all the critical aspects, which need to take care of during the development of the Project.
Like the things this project also has some limitations and can further be enhances by someone,because there are certain drawbacks that do not permit the system to be 100% accurate.
The application is yet to be released and a lot of enhancements are already thought of which are proposed to be implemented in the final version of the web-application. The web-application has also provided feedback page on its home page so that the users can provide their inputs of any functionalities/facilities they would like to have in the web application.

The system is highly flexible one and is well efficient to make easy interactions with the client. The key focus is given on data security, as the project is online and will be transferred in network. The speed and accuracy will be maintained in a proper way.

his will be a user-friendly one and can successfully overcome strict and severe validation checks. The system will be a flexible one and changes whenever can be made easy. Using the facility and flexibility in .NET and SQL, the software can be developed in a neat and simple manner there by reducing the operator’s work.

Since the project is developed in .NET as a front-end and SQL Server as a back-end it can be modified easily and used for a long period. Following are some of the enhancement proposed to be implemented in final version.

-> Maps are provided to facilitate the users.
-> Lease option should be provided regarding properties.
-> Give access of website on mobile and PDAs
-> Send SMS to property owner who have registered and uploaded his property.
-> Giving property site for all metro cities.
-> Upload videos / 3d views of the property.

# CONCLUSION

Working on the project was good experience. I understand the importance of Planning and Designing as a part of software development. But it’s very difficult to complete the program for single person.

system provide major advantages such as speed and accuracy of operation, Time Efficiency, Cost Efficiency, Automatic data validation, Data security and reliability, Easy performance check ,Dynamic and User Friendly. Generates real-time, comprehensive reports and ensures access to complete and critical information, instantly.
